		<h2>Review of chapter 2</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What is the significance of a form’s attribute? Of its attribute? <br>
			elements for taking inputs, action(sent the form data to a page), POST method is most used an more secure, input names are important</li>
			<li>Why must an HTML form that gets submitted to a PHP script be loaded through a URL? What would happen upon submitting the form if it were not loaded through a URL?<br>
			PHP script must be run through a URL, the form must also be run through a URL. Otherwise, when you go to submit the form, you’ll see PHP code  instead of the proper result</li>
			<li>What are the differences between using single and double quotation marks to delineate strings?<br>
			Using single quotation marks in PHP to delineate strings is a great way to avoid extra work when quoting blocks of HTML or any other string that contains a number of double quotation marks. And you don't need to escape the double quotation marks all the time.</li>
			<li>What control structures were introduced in this chapter?</li>
			<li>What new variable type was introduced in this chapter?</li>
			<li>What operator tests for equality? What is the assignment operator?</li>
			<li>Why are textual form elements validated using empty() but other form elements are validated using isset()?</li>
			<li>What is the difference between an indexed array and an associative array?</li>
			<li>With what value do indexed arrays begin (by default)? If an indexed array has ten elements in it, what would the expected index be of the last element in the array?</li>
			<li>What are the superglobal arrays? From where do the following superglobals get their values?<br>
				▸ $_GET<br>
				▸ $_POST<br>
				▸ $_COOKIE<br>
				▸ $_REQUEST<br>
				▸ $_SESSION<br>
				▸ $_SERVER<br>
				▸ $_ENV
			</li>
			<li>How can you print an individual indexed array item? How can you print an individual associative array item? Note: There is more than one answer to both questions.</li>
			<li>What does the count() function do?</li>
			<li>What impact does printing \n have on the browser?</li>
			<li>Generally speaking, when would you use a while loop? When would you use a for loop? When would you use a foreach loop? What is the syntax of each loop type?</li>
			<li>What is the ++ operator? What does it do?</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Pursue</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What version of PHP are you using? If you don’t know, find out now!</li>
			<li>Create a new form that takes some input from the user (perhaps base it on a form you know you’ll need for one of your projects). Then create the PHP script that validates the form data and reports upon the results.</li>
			<li>Rewrite the gender conditional in handle_form.php (Script 2.4) as one conditional instead of two nested ones. Hint: You’ll need to use the AND operator.</li>
			<li>Rewrite handle_form.php (Script 2.4) to use $_POST instead of $_REQUEST.</li>
			<li>Rewrite handle_form.php (Script 2.4) so that it validates the age element. Hint: Use the $gender validation as a template, this time checking against the corresponding pull-down option values (0–29, 30–60, 60+).</li>
			<li>Rewrite the echo statement in the final version of handle_form.php (Script 2.5) so that it uses single quotation marks and concatenation instead of double quotation marks.</li>
			<li>If you’re using PHP 7 or later, change some of the conditionals to use the NULL coalescing operator instead.</li>
			<li>Look up in the PHP manual one of the array functions introduced in this book. Then check out some of the other array-related functions built into the language.</li>
			<li>Create a new array and then display its elements. Sort the array in different ways and then display the array’s contents again.</li>
			<li>Create a form that contains a select menu or series of check boxes that allow for multiple sections. Then, in the handling PHP script, display the selected items along with a count of how many the user selected.</li>
			<li>For added complexity, take the suggested PHP script you just created (that handles multiple selections), and have it display the selections in alphabetical order.</li>
			<li>Learn about form validation in HTML5. This can provide a nicer user experience but does not replace server-side validation, which is always required as client-side validation is easily circumvented.</li>
